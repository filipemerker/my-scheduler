# GraphQL Practice App

A minimal monorepo demonstrating GraphQL client-server integration with Apollo Server and Apollo Client.

## Structure

```
/server    - Apollo Server (Node + TypeScript)
/client    - React app (Vite + TypeScript) with Apollo Client
```

## Iterations

### Iteration 1

Se tthe foundation up, spun up Apollo Server and a React client that talks to it, then wired in Prisma with MongoDB. Created the basic Draft and ScheduledPost models to store content and scheduling info.
